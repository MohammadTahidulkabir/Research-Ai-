**Authors:** Rui Yang, Ziyu Zhu, Yanwei Li et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05491v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework that enhances the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a comprehensive dataset and progressive training pipeline. The VST framework utilizes a two-stage approach, consisting of supervised fine-tuning on the VST-P dataset to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning on the VST-R dataset to improve spatial reasoning abilities. The proposed VST achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, including 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of the spatial tuning paradigm in enhancing VLMs without compromising general capabilities.

### [2] DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction

**Authors:** Abigail Lin
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of DGTN, a novel architecture that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers through a bidirectional diffusion mechanism, enabling the co-learning of structural priors and sequential patterns. This is achieved through a diffusive attention gating mechanism, where GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. The key result is that DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on enzyme DDG prediction benchmarks, with a Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, outperforming baselines by 6.2%, and theoretical analysis shows that the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(T)).

### [3] On Flow Matching KL Divergence

**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the derivation of a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation, specifically bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$ where $\epsilon^2$ is the $L_2$ flow-matching loss. The authors employ techniques from functional analysis and probability theory to establish this bound, which depends on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. The key result is that flow matching achieves a statistical convergence rate under the Total Variation (TV) distance, implying nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions, comparable to that of diffusion models.

### [4] GroupKAN: Rethinking Nonlinearity with Grouped Spline-based KAN Modeling for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation

**Authors:** Guojie Li, Anwar P. P. Abdul Majeed, Muhammad Ateeq et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05477v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of GroupKAN, a lightweight medical image segmentation network that incorporates two novel modules: Grouped KAN Transform and Grouped KAN Activation, which reduce computational complexity from O(C^2) to O(C^2/G) by partitioning channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings. The GroupKAN architecture utilizes grouped spline-based mappings to achieve efficient, token-wise nonlinearity, addressing the limitations of existing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) models. The evaluation results show that GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80% on three medical benchmarks, outperforming U-KAN by 1.11% while requiring only 47.6% of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M).

### [5] A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?

**Authors:** Md. Abdul Awal, Mrigank Rochan, Chanchal K. Roy
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05476v1)
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.LG

**Summary:**
This research paper proposes MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that evaluates the behavioral fidelity of compressed language models of code by comparing their outputs under behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. The framework utilizes three knowledge distillation techniques (Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH) to compress popular language models of code, and then applies metamorphic testing to identify discrepancies in the predictive behavior of the teacher and student models. The results show that MetaCompress can identify up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, with a corresponding performance drop of up to 285% under adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation in knowledge distillation pipelines.

### [6] Semantic-Guided Natural Language and Visual Fusion for Cross-Modal Interaction Based on Tiny Object Detection

**Authors:** Xian-Hong Huang, Hui-Kai Su, Chi-Chia Sun et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05474v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
This paper proposes a novel approach to cross-modal interaction for tiny object detection by integrating the BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), leveraging innovative backbone architectures such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP. The method employs lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques to align semantic cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision for small and complex objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a 52.6% average precision (AP) on the COCO2017 validation set, outperforming YOLO-World and maintaining half the parameter consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP.

### [7] How Many Tokens Do 3D Point Cloud Transformer Architectures Really Need?

**Authors:** Tuan Anh Tran, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Hoai-Chau Tran et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05449v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG

**Summary:**
This research paper introduces gitmerge3D, a novel globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count in 3D point cloud transformer architectures by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. The method achieves this by identifying and merging redundant tokens, thereby challenging the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance. Through experiments on multiple 3D vision tasks, the authors demonstrate that gitmerge3D leads to substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with their optimized models achieving state-of-the-art results at significantly reduced computational and memory costs.

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, I.2.9; I.2.10

**Summary:**
This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models to achieve robust loop closure detection in severely unstructured environments by integrating a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation. The approach combines DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and utilizes SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification, enabling a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. The experiments demonstrate that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision, particularly in low-texture regions, by achieving a precision enhancement and robust pose estimation through the combination of visual and LiDAR modalities.

**Authors:** Samarth Chopra, Alex McMoil, Ben Carnovale et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05397v1)
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.CV

**Summary:**
The EverydayVLA model introduces a unified framework that jointly outputs discrete and continuous actions, leveraging an adaptive-horizon ensemble to monitor motion uncertainty and trigger on-the-fly re-planning for safe and reliable robotic manipulation. This is achieved through a 6-DOF manipulator that can be assembled at a low cost of under $300, utilizing a single vision-language-action model to map visual inputs and language instructions directly to robot actions. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, matching success rates on the LIBERO benchmark and outperforming prior methods by 49% in-distribution and 34.9% out-of-distribution in real-world tests.
