## 🔍 Summary of Recent Works

### [1] Visual Spatial Tuning

**Authors:** Rui Yang, Ziyu Zhu, Yanwei Li et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05491v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework that enhances the spatial ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a progressive training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The VST framework utilizes two large-scale datasets, VST-P (4.1 million samples) and VST-R (135K samples), to cultivate VLMs with human-like visuospatial abilities, focusing on spatial perception and reasoning. The proposed VST approach achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, including 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, without compromising general capabilities.

### [2] TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Junwen Pan, Qizhe Zhang, Rui Zhang et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The proposed TimeSearch-R framework reformulates temporal search as an interleaved text-video reasoning process, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel Group Relative Policy Optimization with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV) method to optimize search strategies. GRPO-CSV addresses the limitations of traditional RL training methods by utilizing the policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench, outperforming the base model Qwen2.5-VL by 4.1% and the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1 by 2.0%.

### [3] MIMIC-SR-ICD11: A Dataset for Narrative-Based Diagnosis

**Authors:** Yuexin Wu, Shiqi Wang, Vasile Rus
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05485v1)
**Categories:** cs.CL, I.2.7; I.5.1

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology, which preserves clinically salient signals from self-reports. The researchers employ a likelihood-based re-ranking framework, LL-Rank, which utilizes a length-normalized joint likelihood computation and PMI-based scoring to improve diagnostic accuracy. The key result is that LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong baseline, GenMap, across seven model backbones, with ablation experiments attributing its gains to the isolation of semantic compatibility from label frequency bias through PMI-based scoring.

### [4] SoilX: Calibration-Free Comprehensive Soil Sensing Through Contrastive Cross-Component Learning

**Authors:** Kang Yang, Yuanlin Yang, Yuning Chen et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05482v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that utilizes Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL) to jointly measure six key soil components: moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic carbon, and aluminosilicates. The 3CL technique incorporates two customized terms, the Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to disentangle cross-component interference and eliminate texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. The system achieves a 23.8% to 31.5% reduction in estimation errors over baseline methods, leveraging a novel tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism to robustly measure soil dielectric permittivity.

### [5] On Flow Matching KL Divergence

**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the derivation of a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation, specifically $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon^2$ is the bound on the $L_2$ flow-matching loss. This bound is achieved through the analysis of the regularities of the data and velocity fields, utilizing techniques from functional analysis and probability theory. The key result is that flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions, with statistical convergence rates comparable to those of diffusion models under the Total Variation (TV) distance.
