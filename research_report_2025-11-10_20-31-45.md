## 🔍 Summary of Recent Works

### [1] Visual Spatial Tuning

**Authors:** Rui Yang, Ziyu Zhu, Yanwei Li et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05491v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework that enhances the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a progressive training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The VST framework utilizes two large-scale datasets, VST-P (4.1 million samples) and VST-R (135K samples), to cultivate VLMs with human-like visuospatial abilities, focusing on spatial perception and reasoning. The proposed VST approach achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, including 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, without compromising general capabilities.

### [2] TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Junwen Pan, Qizhe Zhang, Rui Zhang et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI

**Summary:**
Here is a summary of the research paper in 2-3 clear, technical sentences:

The authors propose TimeSearch-R, a novel approach to temporal search that reformulates the problem as interleaved text-video thinking via reinforcement learning (RL), specifically using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV) to improve the completeness of video reasoning. GRPO-CSV addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by utilizing the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby enhancing the exploration of video content and consistency of logical reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves state-of-the-art performance on various temporal search and long-form video understanding benchmarks, including a 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL on LongVideoBench.

### [3] DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction

**Authors:** Abigail Lin
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The authors propose DGTN, a novel architecture that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers through a bidirectional diffusion mechanism, allowing for co-learning of structural priors and sequential patterns. This is achieved by using learnable diffusion kernels to guide transformer attention with GNN-derived structural embeddings, and refining GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. The authors demonstrate that DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on enzyme DDG prediction benchmarks, with a Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, and provide theoretical analysis showing that the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(T)).

### [4] On Flow Matching KL Divergence

**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV

**Summary:**
Here is a summary of the research paper in 2-3 technical sentences:

The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation, specifically showing that the KL divergence is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$ when the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$. The authors employ techniques from functional analysis and probability theory to establish this bound, which depends on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. The key result is that flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions, with statistical convergence rates comparable to those of diffusion models under the Total Variation (TV) distance.

### [5] AI Literacy Assessment Revisited: A Task-Oriented Approach Aligned with Real-world Occupations

**Authors:** Christopher Bogart, Aparna Warrier, Arav Agarwal et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05475v1)
**Categories:** cs.CY, cs.AI

**Summary:**
This paper proposes a novel, task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy that emphasizes practical skills, such as interpreting model outputs and identifying ethical concerns, over foundational technical knowledge. The authors developed and evaluated this model through a US Navy robotics training program, utilizing a combination of training sessions, practical tasks, and a multiple-choice scenario task designed to simulate real-world AI application. The results showed that the scenario task outperformed traditional tests in measuring applied AI literacy, suggesting that educators should prioritize contextualized, practical assessments when evaluating AI literacy in non-technical workers.
