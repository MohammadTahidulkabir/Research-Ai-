### [1] A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?

**Authors:** Md. Abdul Awal, Mrigank Rochan, Chanchal K. Roy
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05476v1)
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.LG

**Summary:**
This research paper proposes MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that evaluates the behavioral fidelity of compressed language models of code by comparing their outputs under behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. The framework utilizes three knowledge distillation techniques (Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH) to compress large language models, and then applies metamorphic testing to identify discrepancies in the predictive behavior of the teacher and student models. The results show that MetaCompress can identify up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, and reveal that these models can exhibit up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, highlighting the importance of evaluating behavioral fidelity in knowledge distillation pipelines.

**Authors:** Christopher Bogart, Aparna Warrier, Arav Agarwal et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05475v1)
**Categories:** cs.CY, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The authors propose a novel, task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy that emphasizes practical skills, such as interpreting model outputs and identifying ethical concerns, over foundational technical knowledge. To develop and validate this model, they designed a customized AI literacy assessment instrument and accompanying formative assessments, which were administered to participants in a US Navy robotics training program that included a competition with practical tasks and a multiple-choice scenario task. The results showed that the scenario task, which simulated real-world AI application, outperformed traditional tests in measuring applied AI literacy, suggesting that educators should prioritize contextualized, practical skills assessment for workers without technical backgrounds.

**Authors:** Jakub Paplham, Vojtech Franc
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05464v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
This research introduces a novel method for photo dating that leverages a probabilistic framework to combine visual evidence from face recognition and age estimation models with career-based temporal priors. The approach utilizes a newly released dataset, CSFD-1.6M, which contains 1.6 million annotated faces with identity and birth year annotations, enabling the aggregation of multi-face information within a single image. The key finding is that aggregating evidence from multiple faces using this framework consistently improves performance, outperforming scene-based baselines, particularly for images with multiple identifiable individuals.

### [4] The Potential of Copernicus Satellites for Disaster Response: Retrieving Building Damage from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2

**Authors:** Olivier Dietrich, Merlin Alfredsson, Emilia Arens et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05461v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The researchers introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which enables the evaluation of building damage assessment using medium-resolution Earth observation images. They employ a series of experiments using various model architectures to detect and map building damage, finding that simpler models perform comparably to more complex ones, and that geospatial foundation models offer little practical benefit at a 10m ground sampling distance. The key result is that Copernicus images, despite their moderate resolution, can be used to detect and map building damage effectively in many disaster scenarios, making them a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment.

**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05460v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML

**Summary:**
This paper proposes Synapse, a novel arbitration framework that dynamically leverages a pool of Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) by assigning and adjusting predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance. The framework utilizes a adaptive sampling approach to construct a robust forecast distribution from the output quantiles of constituent models, taking into account factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse outperforms other ensembling techniques and individual TSFMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting by effectively exploiting the complementary expertise of diverse TSFMs.

**Authors:** Shiyao Xu, Benedetta Liberatori, Gül Varol et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05369v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, I.2.10; I.4.8; I.5.4

**Summary:**
The authors introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that involves temporally localizing and captioning actions within 3D human motion sequences, and propose a large-scale dataset called Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo) featuring 60,000 richly annotated motion sequences. To address this task, they develop a model called DEMO, which integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, leveraging a carefully designed data generation pipeline to train the model. The experiments demonstrate that DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo and adapted benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3D motion understanding and captioning.

**Authors:** Mikhail Tsukerman, Konstantin Grotov, Pavel Ginzburg
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05357v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.app-ph, physics.comp-ph

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design, which utilizes a 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation to generate structured media geometries from target differential scattering cross-section profiles. This approach employs a diffusion-based methodology to learn the mapping between desired angular scattering patterns and 2x2 dielectric sphere structures, effectively addressing the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. The model achieves a median mean percentage error (MPE) below 19% on unseen targets, outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization and reducing design time from hours to seconds, as demonstrated by its training on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces.

**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO

**Summary:**
This research paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) as agents for cleaning maintenance logs, a crucial step in predictive maintenance (PdM) pipelines, by leveraging their capabilities to handle generic cleaning tasks such as typo correction, missing field imputation, and near-duplicate entry removal. The authors employ LLM-based agents to clean maintenance logs affected by six distinct types of noise, utilizing their language understanding and generation capabilities to rectify errors. The key finding is that LLM agents demonstrate effectiveness in handling generic cleaning tasks, with potential for further improvement through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities to tackle domain-specific errors.
