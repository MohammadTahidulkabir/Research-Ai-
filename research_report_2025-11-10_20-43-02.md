**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework that enhances the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a progressive training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The VST framework utilizes two large-scale datasets, VST-P (4.1 million samples) and VST-R (135K samples), to cultivate spatial perception and reasoning abilities in VLMs. The proposed VST approach achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, including 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, without compromising general capabilities.

**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI

**Summary:**

GRPO-CSV addresses the limitations of traditional RL training methods by utilizing the policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, ensuring more comprehensive exploration of video content and consistent logical reasoning. Through extensive experiments, TimeSearch-R achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench, outperforming the base model Qwen2.5-VL by 4.1% and the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1 by 2.0%.

### [3] DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction

**Authors:** Abigail Lin
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The DGTN architecture introduces a novel diffusive attention gating mechanism that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights and transformer attention through a bidirectional diffusion process, enabling the integration of structural and sequential information. This is achieved by using learnable diffusion kernels to guide transformer attention with GNN-derived structural embeddings, and attention-modulated graph updates to refine GNN message passing. The authors demonstrate that DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on enzyme DDG prediction benchmarks, with a Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, and provide a rigorous mathematical analysis showing that the co-learning scheme converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(T)).

### [4] SoilX: Calibration-Free Comprehensive Soil Sensing Through Contrastive Cross-Component Learning

**Authors:** Kang Yang, Yuanlin Yang, Yuning Chen et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05482v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG

**Summary:**
The SoilX system introduces a calibration-free approach to comprehensive soil sensing by jointly measuring six key components (M, N, P, K, C, Al) using Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), which incorporates an Orthogonality Regularizer and a Separation Loss to disentangle cross-component interference. This is achieved through a novel tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, allowing for robust measurement of soil dielectric permittivity regardless of device placement. The system demonstrates a reduction in estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5% compared to baselines, with good generalization to unseen fields, by explicitly modeling soil texture characteristics (C and Al) to eliminate texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration.

### [5] On Flow Matching KL Divergence

**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the derivation of a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation, specifically bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$ where $\epsilon^2$ is the $L_2$ flow-matching loss. The authors employ techniques from functional analysis and probability theory to establish this bound, which depends on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. The key result is that flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions, with statistical convergence rates under the Total Variation (TV) distance comparable to those of diffusion models.
