### [1] Visual Spatial Tuning

**Authors:** Rui Yang, Ziyu Zhu, Yanwei Li et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05491v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework that enhances the spatial abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a progressive training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The VST framework utilizes two large-scale datasets, VST-P (4.1 million samples) and VST-R (135K samples), to cultivate spatial perception and reasoning capabilities in VLMs. The proposed VST approach achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, including 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, without compromising general capabilities.

### [2] TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Junwen Pan, Qizhe Zhang, Rui Zhang et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of TimeSearch-R, a novel approach that reformulates temporal search as an interleaved text-video thinking process using reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV). This method utilizes a policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, improving the completeness of video reasoning by addressing issues of insufficient exploration and inconsistent logical reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, with a 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL, using a custom-designed dataset that filters out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty.

### [3] DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction

**Authors:** Abigail Lin
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The DGTN architecture introduces a novel diffusive attention gating mechanism that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights and transformer attention through a bidirectional diffusion process, enabling the integration of structural and sequential information. This is achieved by using learnable diffusion kernels to guide transformer attention with GNN-derived structural embeddings, and attention-modulated graph updates to refine GNN message passing. The authors demonstrate that DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on enzyme DDG prediction benchmarks, with a Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, and provide theoretical analysis showing that the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(T)).

### [4] SoilX: Calibration-Free Comprehensive Soil Sensing Through Contrastive Cross-Component Learning

**Authors:** Kang Yang, Yuanlin Yang, Yuning Chen et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05482v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that utilizes Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL) to jointly measure six key soil components: moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic carbon, and aluminosilicates. The 3CL approach incorporates two customized terms, the Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to disentangle cross-component interference and eliminate texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. The system achieves a 23.8% to 31.5% reduction in estimation errors over baseline methods, leveraging a novel tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism to robustly measure soil dielectric permittivity.

### [5] On Flow Matching KL Divergence

**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the derivation of a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation, specifically bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$ where $\epsilon^2$ is the $L_2$ flow-matching loss. The authors employ techniques from functional analysis and statistical estimation to establish this bound, relying on the regularities of the data and velocity fields to determine the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$. The key result is that flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions, with statistical convergence rates under the Total Variation (TV) distance comparable to those of diffusion models.
