### [1] DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction

**Authors:** Abigail Lin
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Summary:**
The DGTN architecture introduces a novel diffusive attention gating mechanism that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights and transformer attention through a bidirectional diffusion process, enabling the integration of structural and sequential information. This is achieved by using learnable diffusion kernels to guide transformer attention with GNN-derived structural embeddings, and attention-modulated graph updates to refine GNN message passing. The authors demonstrate that DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on enzyme DDG prediction benchmarks, with a Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, and provide a rigorous mathematical analysis showing that the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(T)).

### [2] GroupKAN: Rethinking Nonlinearity with Grouped Spline-based KAN Modeling for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation

**Authors:** Guojie Li, Anwar P. P. Abdul Majeed, Muhammad Ateeq et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05477v1)
**Categories:** cs.CV

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of GroupKAN, a lightweight medical image segmentation network that incorporates two novel modules: Grouped KAN Transform and Grouped KAN Activation, which reduce computational complexity from O(C^2) to O(C^2/G) by partitioning channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings. The GroupKAN architecture utilizes grouped spline-based mappings to achieve efficient, token-wise nonlinearity, leveraging the strengths of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) while mitigating their limitations. The evaluation results show that GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80% on three medical benchmarks, outperforming U-KAN by 1.11% while requiring only 47.6% of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M).

**Summary:**
The proposed approach integrates the BERT language model with the Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net) to enable semantic-guided natural language and visual fusion for tiny object detection.

### [4] Precipitation nowcasting of satellite data using physically conditioned neural networks

**Authors:** Antônio Catão, Melvin Poveda, Leonardo Voltarelli et al.
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05471v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG

**Summary:**
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of TUPANN, a physically conditioned neural network that decomposes precipitation nowcasting into motion and intensity fields using a variational encoder-decoder, a lead-time-conditioned MaxViT, and a differentiable advection operator. The model utilizes optical-flow supervision to infer these fields from recent satellite imagery, specifically GOES-16 RRQPE data, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both GOES-16 and IMERG data across various climates and lead times. The key results show that TUPANN outperforms baseline models, including optical-flow and deep learning approaches, with notable improvements at higher precipitation thresholds, and demonstrates transferability and interpretability through smooth motion fields aligned with numerical optical flow.

### [5] Parameter-Efficient Conditioning for Material Generalization in Graph-Based Simulators

**Authors:** Naveen Raj Manoharan, Hassan Iqbal, Krishna Kumar
**Published:** 2025-11-07 | **arXiv:** [2511.05456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05456v1)
**Categories:** cs.LG

**Summary:**
The researchers propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism that enables graph network-based simulators (GNS) to generalize across distinct material types by adaptively modifying the early message-passing (MP) layers. This approach is based on the finding that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the first few (1-5) MP layers, allowing for fine-tuning of only these layers to achieve comparable performance to fine-tuning the entire network. The proposed method achieves accurate long-term rollouts on unseen material properties using as few as 12 short simulation trajectories, representing a 5-fold data reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method.
